The natural logarithm of \(-1\), denoted as \(\ln(-1)\), is not defined in the set of real numbers because the natural logarithm is only defined for positive real numbers in that domain.

However, in the context of complex numbers, \(\ln(-1)\) has a well-defined value. Using the formula for the logarithm of a complex number:

\[
\ln(z) = \ln|z| + i\arg(z),
\]

where \(z\) is a complex number, \(|z|\) is its magnitude, and \(\arg(z)\) is its argument (angle with the positive real axis in the complex plane).

For \(-1\):
- The magnitude \(|-1| = 1\),
- The principal argument \(\arg(-1) = \pi\).

Thus, the natural logarithm of \(-1\) in the complex plane is:

\[
\ln(-1) = \ln(1) + i\pi = 0 + i\pi = i\pi.
\]

Additionally, since the argument of \(-1\) can be expressed as \((2k+1)\pi\) for any integer \(k\) (because arguments are periodic), the general form of \(\ln(-1)\) in the complex plane is:

\[
\ln(-1) = i(2k+1)\pi, \quad k \in \mathbb{Z}.
