The natural logarithm of -1 is a bit of a puzzle because the natural logarithm function, denoted as \(\ln(x)\), is only defined for positive real numbers. 

However, if we delve into the world of complex numbers, we can find an interesting result. In the complex plane, the natural logarithm of -1 is:

\[ \ln(-1) = i\pi \]

Here, \( i \) represents the imaginary unit, and \( \pi \) is the mathematical constant Pi. This is because Euler's formula states:

\[ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 \]

So, when you take the natural logarithm of both sides, you get:

\[ \ln(e^{i\pi}) = \ln(-1) \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ i\pi = \ln(-1) \]
